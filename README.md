# Registration plugin for moodle

This plugin allows us to register users into moodle. It is a test case so it should not be used on production level until properly tested.

This module creates a registration form, the user submits the form and he receives an email with a temporary password and a link which will allow him to change that password. 

Once the password has been changed he will be allowed to use the moodle platform.
